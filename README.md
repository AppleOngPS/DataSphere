# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Description
The goal of this project is to "Increase the efficiency of client onboarding process" for a company called Mindsphere. We worked on improving the website efficiency to enhance
the user experience on the website while streamlining the process of booking a programme, gaining membership, making payment, recieving notifications through emails and using the
chatbot for any queries. We also used APIs to achieve the data analytics page where it would allow admin to view the programmes and create or edit or delete if neccessary. Through
the user dashboard, users can view quizzes, the programmes they participated, and take on quizzes.
